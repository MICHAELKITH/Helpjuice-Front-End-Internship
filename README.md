## üì¶ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MICHAELKITH/Helpjuice-Front-End-Internship.git](https://github.com/MICHAELKITH/Helpjuice-Front-End-Internship.git)
    cd Helpjuice-Front-End-Internship
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Tailwind CSS Setup (if you need to modify styles):**

    * **Initialize Tailwind CSS:**
        ```bash
        npx tailwindcss init -p
        ```
        This will create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files.

    * **Configure Tailwind CSS:**
        Modify your `tailwind.config.js` to include your content paths (e.g., HTML and JavaScript files).

    * **Create your main CSS file (e.g., `css/style.css`)** and add the Tailwind directives:
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```

    * **Build the CSS:**
        You can either run the PostCSS command directly or add it as an npm script.

        **Direct Command:**
        ```bash
        npx postcss css/style.css -o build/style.css -w
        ```
        (The `-w` flag watches for changes)

        **npm Script:**
        Add the following to your `package.json` under the `scripts` section:
        ```json
        "build:css": "npx postcss css/style.css -o build/style.css --watch"
        ```
        Then run:
        ```bash
        npm run build:css
        ```

4.  **Open `index.html` in your browser** to view the prototype.
